# CSV-to-Mermaid
A very simple MacOS application that creates Mermaid markdown from a copy-pasted CSV file.

I create a disassembly spreadsheet (using Google Sheets) that has lots of information about how to take apart a device. Often times, I need to create a flowchart to visualize this. With this application, I can download the formatted CSV file from Google Sheets, copy it into the application, and voila! Now I have Mermaid markdown that is easily turned into a flowchart!
